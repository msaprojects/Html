    <p>To Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him
        mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and
        predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion
        akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,
        were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He
        was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
        the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a
        false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
        and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observerâ€”excellent for
        drawing the veil from menâ€™s motives and actions. But for the trained
        reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
        adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might
        throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive
        instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
        be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And
        yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene
        Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
